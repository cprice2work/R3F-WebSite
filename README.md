# 🌎🖥React 3 Fiber Portfolio🖱


This is a portfolio website that showcases some of my front-end development skills. 
1. To make the site more engaging and interactive, I have utilized three.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser. This allows for unique animations and interactivity with models on the site.

2. The styling of the site is done using TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid prototyping and easy customization. I have also imported various components, including Tilt, to add additional functionality to the site.

3. Take a look around and explore the site, and don't hesitate to reach out to me through the contact section if you have any questions or would like to work together.
